Stateless functional component: It's a javascript function, which optionally receives object of Properties as props, and then retruns the HTML content 
								as JSX,which describes the UI.

Here, i had created, Greet.js file in src/component
1) Created a simple 'function Greet' and returned simple html content
2) Now, to connect and use 'function Greet' in other components, we need to
	connect it to react, to use this component, which is done by command,
	"export default Greet(functionName)"

3)To use Greet component into App.js in src/App.js, need to import Greet,
  which is done by command,
	import Greet from './component/Greet';

	and use this in form of '<Greet>' if no parameter have to send, else
	like '<Greet> parameter </Greet>'


	3.1)If components was not exported from step 2, you will get the following error,
		as follows,

			./src/App.js
			Attempted import error: './component/Greet' does not contain
			a default export (imported as 'Greet').

4)Greet function with arrow component
	GreetArrow.js in component imported in App.js as Greet Function
