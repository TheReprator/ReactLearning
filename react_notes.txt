StateFull class component: It's a javascript ES6 classes, which optionally receives object of Properties
			 as props, and then retruns the HTML content as JSX,which describes the UI. Apart from props,
			 it also maintain a private internal state(means some information, which is private to this
			 component), which can be used further to describe the user interface.

Here, i had created, ClassGreetCompnent.js file in src/component
1) Created a simple 'class Greet' and override the render method. In render method, return is compulsary,
	where you have to return the html(return <h1>Class Component</h1>) or null content(return ). 
	Returning null will crash the page.

2) It is upto you, to write the export on class name*(as in this file) or at last line, as done earlier



3)Functional VS Class Component
 a)Simple functions
	a.1)Simple function
	a.2)Use Function as much as possible
	a.3)absence of this keyword
	a.4)Solution without using state
	a.5)Mainly responsible for UI
	a.6)Stateless/ Dumb/ Presentation

b)Class Component:
	b.1)More feature reach i.e.(private data, states, hooks, more class complex logic)
	b.2)statefull/ Smart / Container
