Stateless functional component: It's a javascript function, which optionally receives object of Properties as props, and then retruns the HTML content 
								as JSX,which describes the UI.

Here, i had created, Greet.js file in src/component
1) Created a simple 'function Greet' and returned simple html content
2) Now, to connect and use 'function Greet' in other components, we need to
	connect it to react, to use this component, which is done by command,
	"export default Greet(functionName)"

3)To use Greet component into App.js in src/App.js, need to import Greet,
  which is done by command,
	import Greet from './component/Greet';

	and use this in form of '<Greet>' if no parameter have to send, else
	like '<Greet> parameter </Greet>'


	3.1)If components was not exported from step 2, you will get the following error,
		as follows,

			./src/App.js
			Attempted import error: './component/Greet' does not contain
			a default export (imported as 'Greet').
	
	3.2) You can import the component by any name until "default" keyword is present in "export default Greet"
		which i had done, in App.js like,

   		import NormalJavaScriptFunction from './component/Greet'
		and used as  '<NormalJavaScriptFunction />'

		Once, you remove the "export default functionName" from component and apply it on function directly
		on function itself, as i had done in GreetArrow.js,
			then you have to import the same function name in the included component, you can't change the 
			name, i.e.
			  import { GreetArrow } from './component/GreetArrow'; 
			  	bcz default is not preset in GreetArrow, and export is directly bundled on function itself.

4)Greet function with arrow component
	GreetArrow.js in component imported in App.js as Greet Function
