    In order to use any css module, file name should have extension of fileName.module.css like the file
    'cssModule.module.css' in src/stylingReact/CSS folder

    import it where as in case of reguar css, once defined in parent component, there is no need to
    import it in child component, for further refernce kindly look into video no. 'ReactJS Tutorial - 20 - Styling and CSS Basics(720P_HD)'
